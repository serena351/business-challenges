    "You're in charge of generating data in a data warehouse based on inputs received from another source. In particular, you've been tasked with handling customer details in the form of generating a username for them based on 2 simple aspects: Their full name and their birth year. Suppose for simplicity that all users only use 1 first name and 1 surname.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you receive from the source is their full name, in a tuple (firstname, lastname) format, and their birth year as an integer. The values accepted are between 1911 and 2010, inclusive. The username generating method is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `firstname`: You only take the first letter, as uppercase\n",
    "- You add an underscore separator\n",

To avoid this, the system will send, if needed, an integer value in case the original username was already in the system. \n",

    "That is: If `A_smith90` was already in the system, you would instead receive the complete input:\n",
    "`[(Anastasia, Smith), 1990, 27]`. Adding *another underscore* in between, this would generate the username: `A_smith90_27`. You need not worry about username duplication, since the input will only send an additional integer (between 0 and 99 inclusive) if needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You ALWAYS receive 1 tuple of (`firstname`, `lastname`) and 1 *integer* between *1911 - 2010* (and *sometimes* a 3rd element, an *integer* between *0* and *99*) inside a list, but you don't always receive them in the same order. That is, the following inputs are all valid:\n",
